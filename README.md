# BattPop
BattPop is a small (30kb) windows application that functions as a task tray application and allows the user to be able to quickly see that status and charge of the battery via a keyboard shortcut. This shortcut is Ctrl + Alt + B. This will a windows toast notification to show the percentage and status of your battery.

Example of the notification the application sends when the key combo is used. 

I was always annoyed at how much effort was needed to see the remaining battery on windows. Especially on Windows 11. You have to move the cursor to the battery and then wait for a popup to occur. Something that used to be easier on Windows 10 because the percentage used to be on the taskbar. 

Right clicking the icon in the task tray will allow you to exit the program. During running it uses circa 1 meg of RAM. I hope this saves you a bit of time while using Windows on the go.
